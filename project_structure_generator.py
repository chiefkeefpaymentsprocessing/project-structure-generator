# The purpose of this script is to generate a structured and formatted representation of a project's directory and file hierarchy.
# This script is particularly useful for developers who need to document and understand the layout of a large project. It ensures that
# directories and files are presented in a readable and organized manner, with special handling to ignore specific directories,
# define which files to include in the output, and group files with similar naming patterns.
# 
# The pattern logic allows listing only one of each of the values defined as a pattern. For example, if you have 10 CSV files in a folder
# that increment in value, instead of listing all of them (which would make the output very long), it will list just one for each folder.
# The output will not repeat or output folders that have the same depth and final folder name.
